Project: Web Scraper for images and links
         To use it, import [scraper](https://github.com/igorfala/karan-projects/blob/master/Web/Page-Scraper/scraper.py) and
         call the : linkScraper(URL,DB) function.
         or imageScraper(URL, DB), where URL is the Uniform Resource Locator and
         DB is the database where the results will be saved. (e.g. DB.sqlite in this case)
