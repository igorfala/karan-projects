Project: Fetch Current Weather\n
         To use it, import the [weather](https://github.com/igorfala/karan-projects/blob/master/Web/Weather/weather.py), or
         or [weather1](https://github.com/igorfala/karan-projects/blob/master/Web/Weather/weather1.py) ,and
         call the : weather() function.
         It can be called with weather('Location name')
         or weather('zip code') # note that zip code 
         needs to be string. If weather() is called with no 
         arguments, it determines your location automatically.
